NOTE: This is a Feature-First approach of folder structure

----------------- Bindings --------------------

In this folder we are going to deal with all the get x commands

------------------ common ---------------------

In the common folder, we are going to place all the common styles and widgets and anything else that will be common in the project

------------------- data ----------------------

In the data folder, we will have two things that are going to deal with cloud queries:

(1) repositories: This mostly deals with FireStore, FireBase
(2) services: This deals with APIs and Payment Services


----------------- features --------------------

In the features folder, we will have 3 features:

(1) authentication
(2) personalization
(3) shop

Each above feature will contains there own:

(1) controllers
(2) models
(3) screens

NOTE: You can add more features in the features folder in future

--------------- localization ------------------

------------------ utils ---------------------- (V.IMP)

This folder is very IMPORTANT folder. It Contains 9 things:

(1) constants
(2) device
(3) formatters
(4) helpers
(5) http
(6) local_storage
(7) logging

(1) constants: Inside constants, we will place all the files whose variable are constant and will never change
    This includes: colors.dart, enums.dart, image_strings.dart, texts.dart, sizes.dart, api_constants.dart

(2) device: Everything related to device functions will going to be inside the device folder.
    These functions includes writing helper functions like: how to hide keyboard, Status Bar Color, landscape/horizontal orientation, set full screen, set screen height, set screen width etc.

(3) formatters: In this folder we will place all the format related things.
    This includes: date formatters, helper function to set date format, currency formats, phone number formats etc.

(4) helpers: We are going to add all helper functions inside this folder.
    Helper function means that only a user input is taken (checkbox, selectors etc) and the task will be done automatically. The examples are provided above

(5) http, (6) local_storage, (7) logging are all kinds of helper functions

(8) theme: This folder is very IMPORTANT as this contains the pre-defined theme for every app.
    If you have defined theme for every component inside your app then your 80% task IS DONE. Then you only have to place each components inside the app.

(9) validators: This folder will contains the validators.
    These validators includes validators of email, password, phone numbers, full name etc.
